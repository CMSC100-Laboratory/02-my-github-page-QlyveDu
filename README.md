### Steps on how to create GitHub page
1. Create A repository and make sure it is set on public
2. With your html, push your _**index.html**_ to your repo
3. Go to **Settings** of your repo and on the category of **Pages**
4. Under the **Build and Deployment** click on and change selected branch to **main** or your desired branch then press save.
5. **Most Importantly!** wait a couple of minutes and go back to **Pages** where you will see the link assigned to your website!

_PS: you can also read the [docs _here..._](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)_

### What are my key takeaways from this exercise? 
* Frontend is hell, a lot of exeperience and niche stuff. I'm amazed by how people before our current technology was able to make websites and do not get tired off repeating and trying out different attributes or effects just to follow your dream website...
* To be continued... _I have not finished the exercise yet_
